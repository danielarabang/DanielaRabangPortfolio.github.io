							<p  style="color:rgb(213, 215, 209)">Studying CPE232 - Managing Enterprise Systems was like peeking behind the scenes of how big companies keep their computer systems running smoothly. I learned that making these systems work well involves paying attention to the little things. It's a bit like tuning an instrument—small changes can make a big difference.</p>
							<p  style="color:rgb(213, 215, 209)">Figuring out how to set up, protect, and speed up these systems was a mix of challenging and exciting moments. I was amazed at how even tiny adjustments could make everything safer and faster.Understanding how crucial these systems are for companies made me excited to be part of managing them in the future.</p>
							<p  style="color:rgb(213, 215, 209)">I picked up a lot about cloud computing and monitoring systems, not just for exams but to keep pushing myself even when things got tough. This course taught me that every small step counts toward reaching your goals. Though I've learned a lot, I know there's much more to grasp—especially about fixing problems and managing servers. I'm grateful for the support of my friends, classmates, and my amazing professor who helped me through the ups and downs of this course. Finishing this course feels like a big achievement, and I'm eager to use what I've learned in the future to manage enterprise systems better.</p>
